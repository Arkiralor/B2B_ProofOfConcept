The patience it must have taken!\n\nAnd ofc Divyanshu, being the constant pillar of support:\u201d)\n\nCourtesy you wonderful people, I enjoyed the process even when I was clueless. Laughing at my mistakes while you gave me quizzical expressions I knew that I was growing, and so were you.\n\nAs much as I\u2019d like to believe it has all been just me, I know it was always backed by someone who looked at me and said \u201cTu kar legi\u201d with shiny eyes.

DK \n\nThe story of Dinesh Karthik is amazing.\n\nHe was doing very well and was the 2nd wkt keeper to MS in the Indian team and was captain of TN. \n\nHis teammate Murali Vijay was having an affair with his wife and the entire TN Ranji team knew this but not DK.\n\nFinally one day she told him she was pregnant carrying Murali Vijay's child and wanted a divorce. \n\nThey had a divorce and she moved in with Murali who was opening for CSK and India and doing well. \n\nDK was shattered, went into a deep depression, grew a beard, became a Devdas, his performance dipped, and he was dropped from the India squad. \n\nHe started failing in Ranji and lost his captaincy to Murali Vijay. He started failing in IPL too and was so depressed felt let down by his Ranji teammates and wanted to commit suicide. He stopped going to the gym.\n\nHis trainer visited him in his house and found DK in a complete mess. He insisted Dk start his training again and got him back to the gym where he was training Deepika Pallikal also.\n\nShocked to see him in a sorry state she started counselling him along with the trainer and slowly he started training. Both started working out like maniacs.\n\nMurali Vijay married his wife but started failing, was first dropped from the Indian team and later from CSK also.\n\nMeanwhile encouraged by Deepika, DK started nets and scored heavily in the domestic matches. \n\nHe was back in the reckoning, was again selected for white-ball cricket for India and became the captain of KKR. He married Deepika.\n\nHowever, after a few years, Rishab came and took his place.\nAt 34 he knew his time was up and he was dropped from KKR as captain. He wanted to retire and just play IPL. \n\nHis wife got pregnant and they had twins. She also stopped playing. \n\nHis dream was to own a luxurious house which he got as an offer at Poes garden. It cost a lot and he was not too sure if he could afford it. \n\nDeepika said grab it, we will both come back. She started training along with DK. They bought the palatial house in Poes garden.\n\nDeepika played the world championship at Glasgow in squash 6 months after delivery and won both the mixed doubles and women's double. \n\nAn energised father, now DK started kicking ass.\nHope he makes it this time once again!! \n\n#cricket #ipl #india #motivation #inspiration #nevergiveup ",

Make sure to provide a good work-life balance to all in the organisation. Acknowledge the hard work that your team puts in. Make employees wellness a part of the org culture. We grow when we support and take care of each other \ud83e\udd1d\n\nOn the same note, the Class of 2022 will be graduating in a few months. \nSome of them would already be having pre-placement offers, others would be preparing hard for that dream job. A few would also be going for Masters in specific domains. \nAt this point of the life journey, we often stay very stressed. \nBut trust me you have lots of time and this is just the beginning.

Shaw Group and Goldman Sachs. So, I thought to jot down the answers to all such queries.\n\n\ud83e\udd14 How did you apply?\n\n\u2705 Goldman \u2014 It was an off-campus opportunity and I applied directly on the GS portal without any referral\n\u2705 Shaw \u2014 It was an on-campus opportunity\n\n\u23f3 How much time did I take for the prep?\n\nI started preparing for internships after the lockdown happened in 2020 March (it was halfway through my 4th sem). For the initial 3-4 months I prepared very rigorously. But once, I grasped a grip on DSA, I became less regular (not recommended at all \u274c) and eventually used to resume only when there was an OA or interview...\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Interview Processes?\n\n\u2705 Goldman (off-campus) \u2014 1 Aptitude OA (pretty decent/hard level), 1 Technical round (2 small coding questions, 1 advanced coding q., a maths section, a CS fundamentals section), 2 technical interviews, 1 managerial round\n\u2705 Shaw (on-campus) \u2014 1 OA (2 coding q., an aptitude section and a CS fundamental section), 2 technical interviews, 1 managerial round (may or may not take place)\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Resources used for DSA?\n\nAfter building a good grip on DSA through Leetcode, I did some amazingly curated lists for revisions and to cover all the important topics:\n\n1. Strivers\u2019 Sheet: https://bit.ly/3vydeKg\n2. Leetcode\u2019s Top Interview Questions\u2019 List: https://bit.ly/3Ktr19i\n3. Interview Experiences from GfG: https://bit.ly/3MKiuQK\n\n\u2753 How many questions did I solve?\n\nI solved a total of 600+ questions on Leetcode. Seems overwhelming right? But I achieved this in a long span. In the end, everything boils down to the quality of questions you\u2019ve solved and not the quantity. So, the moment you feel confident about a certain topic, you\u2019re good to go!\n\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Any YouTube channels I followed?\n\nTechdose, takeUforward, Back To Back SWE, Nick White, Kevin Naughton Jr, Aditya Verma, and a few others.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf Important DSA topics to focus upon?\n\nArrays (Binary Search, Hash Map, Two pointers, Greedy, Sliding Window), Trees, Graph, Linked List, Stack & Queue, Heap, Strings, Recursion (Backtracking), Dynamic Programming\n\n\ud83e\udd1d\ud83c\udffb Can you refer me?\n\nSure, I would love to do so. But wait for me to post about the opportunity where I can refer you, and then you can reach out to me!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 Some more Recommended resources for DSA (I have collected these from various sources):\n\n1. Neetcode: https://neetcode.io/\n2. Sean Prashad\u2019s Leetcode Patterns: https://bit.ly/3KzLsRS\n3. Blind 75: (https://bit.ly/3MDSma8) / Blind 50: (https://bit.ly/3KyN3HU)\n4. work@tech: https://bit.ly/3vWjcno\n\n*********************************************\n\nI hope this was helpful.

Featuring the distinctive and purpose-driven ducktail spoiler that pays tribute to the 911 Carrera RS 2.7 of the early 1970s, production of the new iteration is limited to 1,250 examples worldwide.\n\nThis new, limited-production model is a true driver's car. It features a unique powertrain to complement its special design, which pays homage to past Porsche models. This is also the second model borne of the Heritage Design strategy, which began with the 911 Targa 4S Heritage Design Edition in 2020.\n\nManual transmission, rear-wheel drive, and 543 hp\n\nThe new Porsche 911 Sport Classic is based on the 911 Turbo S, benefitting from its wide-body layout. Unlike the 911 Turbo models, the Sport Classic is available exclusively with a seven-speed manual transmission powering the rear wheels. Its engine, generating 543-hp and 442 lb.-ft. of torque, is the same 3.7-liter twin-turbo flat-six found in the 911 Turbo models with revised engine mapping to deliver output compatible with the manual transmission. That combination also makes this the most powerful 911 with a manual transmission currently available.\n\nBecause the new model is based on the 911 Turbo S, it too features a comprehensive list of high performance equipment. Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB) with calipers in black, Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC), Rear Axle Steering, the Sport Chrono Package, and a specially modified Sport Exhaust system are all included as standard. Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) Sport is also standard and lowers the ride height by 10 millimeters. Due to the fact that this is a rear-wheel drive model, the front axle spring rates are slightly decreased by comparison to the all-wheel drive 911 Turbo S.\n\nDespite its undeniable sports car pedigree, the Porsche 911 Sport Classic is designed with driver enjoyment in mind and while it's certainly up to the task of turning quick track laps, this limited-edition model emphasizes style and driving pleasure above all else.",

The discovery, published in Nature, makes use of 2D quantum materials and paves the way towards superconducting computing. Superconductors can make electronics hundreds of times faster, all with zero energy loss.

It was expected that I will break my fast on the flight and for the same, I was carrying a bottle of water (the corporate meal was booked anyways). When my fellow passenger (a Jain woman) got to know that I was fasting, she immediately took out her bag and offered me a couple of dates. Further, the IndiGo (InterGlobe Aviation Ltd)  team offered me dates and snacks to break my fast. I accepted dates from fellow aunty with gratitude and requested low sugar (as usual) coffee from the team Indigo. \n\nThis is what diversity looks like in #MeraWalaIndia. Sometimes, small efforts can bring smiles to someone's face.  Let's take that small step and try bringing smiles to as many people as we could. \n\nP.S. I never thought a small gesture by a fellow passenger would spread so much positivity. Bonus point, she also asked me, Roze kaise jaa rahe hain tumhare (how is your fast going) and we discussed a couple of things about Ramdan & Paryushana.\n\n#HamaraWalaIndia\n#unityindiversity \n#JaiHind\n#diversityandinclusion  \n#indigoairlines ",

It was my absolute pleasure to host this historic rendezvous as part of the \u201cHandshake Program\u201d on behalf of Decathlon Sports India. It gave us a common ground to share our core values and it was an eye-opener for all of us to realize how identically structured they are. Through each activity we collectively indulged in, such as playing various sports to having lunch together, we bridged the gap between our work cultures more and more and coalesced in our deeply rooted passion for the respective organizations we work in. It truly emphasized the positive outcomes of organizations co-existing harmoniously in the same ecosystem and how they can mutually benefit from others' principles. Needless to say, We couldn't have asked for a better cross-over!!\n\n#decathlon\u00a0#ikea #sportsforall #sports #work #india #share #mumbai \nIKEA\nKevin Sunny Dheeraj Bhave Shiwangi Mehta Daniel Fernandes Kalyani Kodavatiganti",

At IIT Guwahati, I earned my PhD in Design (Product Design). Additionally, I am a certified Professional Engineer by the Institution of Engineers (India). What I am sharing are from my experience.\n\nAs you are all aware, business incubators and technological incubators are two types of incubation. Business incubators by nature and can primarily help with the business incubator function. Without a doubt, they are experts in this area.\n\nProduct-based startups must initially go through technology incubation. Following third-party audits, when the auditors certify that the product has reached Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRL) 8 or 9, they should approach the Business Incubators. \n\nA third-party audit is essential for the successful launch of a product. Generally, I observe that product-based startups approach business incubators when their products reach MRL 3 or 4. As a result, most product-based startups are unable to sustain themselves in the competitive market.\n\nNo matter how hard the business incubator tries, if your product is not acceptable to the mass market, you will have a hard time becoming successful in the industry.\n\nAs an example, if someone is designing a new piece of furniture, various ergonomic factors must be considered during the design process. The use of 3D simulation software, such as Ansys, Catia, etc., is also essential.\n\nIf someone is working on a mobile application, then usability testing is a must. Similarly, they must prepare a solid, low-fidelity prototype before they begin programming.\nThe product will not be successful unless these steps are taken.\n\nOur team came across a gentleman starting a business in the field of electric tourist vehicles. A price of 3 lakh rupees has been determined for the vehicle.\n\nIn response to our inquiry whether he had conducted the crash test of the vehicle (which is mandatory), he stated that he had not done so. \n\nThe answer to our question concerning flow simulation and dashboard design was negative this time. Now, if he approaches any business incubator with an incomplete product, it is almost certain that the product cannot sustain itself in the market. It will not be fair for the entrepreneur to blame the Business Incubation Organization in such a situation.\n\nA person interested in technological incubation and prototyping may visit the Tool Room and Training Center at Amin Gaon in addition to IITG.\nOne may approach the Assam Don Bosco University for bio-technical and biomechanical prototypes.\nFor prototypes relating to UAVs, one may approach Z-Motion, etc.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the generation of funds is secondary - unless the angel investor is not impressed with someone's product; it is difficult to find the right angel investor. They will invest when they are confident the new product will generate profits.",

            "content": "\u201cI was born in a Dalit family, in a village in Akola. When I was 12, everyone pushed my dad to get me married to a man, 10 years my senior, who lived in Mumbai. My dad didn\u2019t want to, but because of societal pressure, I was married off. \nI came here and learned that his family lived in one room in a slum and he didn\u2019t even have a job. I was treated horribly \u2013 if there was extra salt in the food I cooked or any mistakes I made, I was beaten up by my in-laws... It was my personal hell. \nAfter 6 months, my father visited me \u2013 he couldn\u2019t even recognize me. I was in ragged clothes and I\u2019d lost my smile. He fought with my in-laws and took me home. Telling me to forget about it like a bad dream. \nBut people started blaming me. I even tried to commit suicide - and they still said that I was giving up because I HAD done something wrong, not the other way around. It was then that I realised that if I was going to be blamed in any case, I\u2019d rather live. \nWith this new leaf turned, I returned to Mumbai and worked as a tailor. That was the first time I saw what Rs. 100 looked like. I rented a room in Kalyan with my savings and called my family here. We were managing fine - but when we couldn\u2019t afford to save my sister\u2019s life, I realised that I needed to make more money for my family. So I took a government loan and started my own furniture business. It was doing well and we began living a better life. \nBut there were so many people out there struggling, just like I used to. So I started an NGO to help them get loans. Sometimes, I helped them out of my own pocket and slowly built a good reputation for my social work.\nWhich is why the workers of Kamani Tubes asked me to help save their company. It was tied up in 140 litigation cases, with a debt of 116 crores. Everyone told me that it was suicide \u2013 but 500+ families were starving! So I chose to help, wanting nothing but justice for them in return. I spoke to the finance minister and he got the debt reduced. I gathered a team and shifted factories. Everything I tried was new \u2013 but there was no fear left in me. \nIn 2006, I became the chairman. We were told to pay off the bank loans within 7 years. We did it within 1 and we even managed to pay the workers. Slowly and surely, things changed and today, the turnover is more than we could dream of, I was even awarded the Padma Shri in 2013 for my work. I\u2019ve had an unbelievable journey, from a Dalit Child-Bride to an owner of a multi-million dollar company. It\u2019s been tough - but I\u2019ve made sure to never let the fear of challenges overpower me. I took me a long time to learn that, but now that I have, I can\u2019t choose to face life without having full faith in myself.\u201d\n\n#dalit #childmarriage #abuse #familysupport #work #job #business #womenentrepreneurs #ngo #chairman #padmashri #femaleleadership #hustle #inspiration #socialwork #journey #humansofbombay",

Bought back The Maharaja, now look at the vast change in service. Introduced Nano which we people disregarded is our biggest shame. Brought back IPL from the Chinese brands. I am very sure that Tata Neu will be a hit too. A lot of uncountable deeds which no one can forget. I think the Tatas shall be given a Noble Prize for their deeds to the society.

All humans are not business oriented nor can they even finance it.\nIf we do the correct math, 90 people out of 100 total population cannot own a business. The logic of demand and supply also cease to exist.\n\nPass out the talent compass - Teach and guide us to the right path. Train people about the job and throw them to exercise those knowledge. Not everyone can run, own or lead a business per se.\n\nSome people are made to lead, some to follow, some to work, some to learn while some are made to teach and that could be you!\n\nPass out the compass!\n\n\n\n\n\n#business #people #entrepreneurs #economy #community #future #finance #job #work #opportunities #talent #northeastindia #nagaland #kohima #dimapur #NEIndia #naga #localbusiness #employment #localeconomy #entrepreneur #entrepreneurship #entrepreneurs #startup #bluecollar #whitecollar #compass #msmeindia #msme #futuregeneration #comingofage #realitycheck",

Here, we show that kidney epithelial cells are active mechano-biological fluid pumps. \n\nBrief Summary:\n\tThe human kidney consists of roughly 30 kilometers of epithelial tubules that re-absorb 180L of water per day. I developed a microfluidic device to grow kidney epithelial cells in a physiologically relevant manner and measure fluid flow and pressure gradient developed across the epithelium. In doing so, we discovered that kidney epithelial cells behave like mechanical water pumps, in that they can pump fluid to generate a hydraulic pressure gradient. Epithelial cells regulate their fluid pumping performance by sensing this hydraulic pressure gradient.\u00a0Additionally, I discovered that diseased kidney cells pump fluid in the reverse direction, creating cysts that render the system dysfunctional, adding novel mechanical insight to kidney epithelial function and disease.\n\n#Mechanobiology #Tissuehydraulics #KidneyPump",

And, your money would stay the same.\n- Provided you can grow your wealth at 10%+. \n- Math: Assume inflation @6%, your money grows at 10%. So net you are making INR 4 on INR 100 savings.\n\n[4] Improving your earning potential is the best investment: \n\n- Money making = adding value. \n- Hence, the more skilled you are (at any trait), the more value to can add. And, the more money you can make. \n- Best part, if you are skilled, you save your own time. \n\n[5] Time >> Money\n\n- Theoretically, we can make infinite money. \n- But, all of us have finite amount of time (and we don't even know how much). \n- So keep meetings shorts, avoid unnecessary drama, cut toxic people; and don't waste your time and other people's time.\n\n****\nLearn Investing & Management Consulting: https://wisdomhatch.com/",

The money that our company dedicated from my salary with a promise that it'll be provided to be when I leave the company.\n\nManager - Sorry we cannot give the PLI to anyone who hasn't completed atleast 1 year in the company.\n\nMe - But I wasn't told about this before. Also it isn't written anywhere in my offer letter!\n\nManager - Oh it isn't written? Sorry HR would must have forgotten to write it.\n\nMe - With all due respect, your one sorry shouldn't cost me more than a lakh rupees!\n\nManager - Oh! But you should know that PLI is performance based. We can show that you were under performing and give you 0% PLI.\n\nMe - How can I be under performing when I won 3 employee of the month awards in last 8 months!\n\nManager - Don't argue Shivansh! Let me see what can I do for you. But I cannot promise anything.\n\nMe - Yes please try and do the needful as the amount is huge! If not full , kindly provide me a partial PLI.\n\nI resigned with a hope of receiving my PLI along with other dues.\n\nFinally after multiple calls to the HR, \nremaining settlement which included my notice period salary and leaves encashment was done after 2 months.

Digital creators are making waves - both with their extensive reach & distribution and their refreshing content as well.\n\nA key reason why film stars are very particular about collaborating with digital stars to talk about their next big project. Here are two key exhibits we see in front of us for the movie KGF 2:\n\n1. Yash chose to work only with Niharika NM to create a hilarious video which made waves and how. It hit 1M views on Instagram within 3 hours and currently sits at 14M+ views across all platforms.\n\n2. Sanjay Dutt chose to spend an hour on The Ranveer Show opening up about the darkest phases of his life and what we should learn from his mistakes.\n\nWhat I love most about these collaborations is they happen on an equal footing, unlike other interactions. The creator appreciates the art that the film star is creating, the film star appreciates the grit it takes to build a massive social media audience.",

Mother works without pay for the family, Dad spends all his pay for the family, both their efforts are equal, still don\u2019t know why Dad is lagging behind.\n\n3. Mom cooks whatever you want, Dad buys whatever you want, both their love is equal, but Mom\u2019s love is shown as superior. Don\u2019t know why Dad is lagging behind.\n\n4. When you talk over the phone, you want to talk to Mom first, if you get hurt, you cry \u2018Mom\u2019. You will only remember dad when you need him, but Dad never feels bad that you don\u2019t remember him the other times? When it comes to receiving love from children, for generations, don\u2019t know why Dad is lagging behind.\n\n5. Cupboards will be filled with colorful sarees and many clothes for kids but Dad\u2019s clothes are very few, he doesn\u2019t care about his own needs, still don\u2019t know why Dad is lagging behind.\n\n6. Mom has many gold ornaments, but Dad has only one ring that was given during his wedding. Still Mom may complain of less jewellery and Dad doesn't. Still don't know why is Dad lagging behind.\n\n7. Dad works very hard all his life to take care of the family, but when it comes to getting recognition, don't know why he is always lagging behind.\n\n8. Mom says, we need to pay college tuition this month, please don\u2019t buy a saree for me for the festival whereas dad has not even thought of new clothes.Both their love is equal, still don\u2019t know why Dad is lagging behind.\n\n9. When parents become old, children say, Mom is at least useful in taking care of household chores, but they say, Dad is useless.\n\nDad is behind (or \u2018at the back\u2019 ) because he is the backbone of the family.

His teammate Murali Vijay was having an affair with his wife and the entire TN Ranji team knew this but not DK.\n\nThey had a divorce and she moved in with Murali who was opening for CSK and India and doing really well. \n\nDK was shattered, went into deep depression, grew a beard & his performance dipped, and he was dropped from the India squad. He started failing in Ranji and lost his captaincy to Murali Vijay. He started failing in IPL too and was so depressed felt let down by his Ranji teammates and wanted to commit suicide. He stopped going to the gym.\n\nHis trainer visited him in his house and found DK in a complete mess. He insisted Dk start his training again and got him back to the gym where he was training Deepika Pallikal also.\n\nShocked to see him in a sorry state she started counselling him along with the trainer and slowly he started training. Both started working out like maniacs.\n\nMurali Vijay married his wife but started failing....was first dropped from the Indian team and later from CSK also. Meanwhile encouraged by Deepika, DK started nets and scored heavily in the domestic matches. He was back in the reckoning, was again selected for white-ball cricket for India and became the captain of KKR.\n\nHe married Deepika.\nHowever, after a few years, Rishab came and took his place.\n\nAt 34 he knew his time was up and he was dropped from KKR as captain. He wanted to retire and just play IPL. His wife got pregnant and they had twins. She also stopped playing. \n\nHis dream was to own a luxurious house which he got as an offer at Poes garden. It cost a lot and he was not too sure if he could afford it. Deepika said grab it, we will both come back. She started training along with DK. They bought the palatial house.\n\nDK got a call from Kasi of CSK saying thala wanted him as wk when he retired from CSK and DK was in reckoning. At the auction in 2022, CSK tried their best to get him but were outbid by RCB. CSK settled for Devon Conway. \n\nDeepika played the world championship at Glasgow in squash 6 months after delivery & won both the mixed doubles & women's double with Joshna Ponnappa. An energised father, now DK started kicking ass, won crucial matches for RCB. He is now back with a bang and wants to make it into the T20 WC team as a finisher in place of retired MS. \n\nHope he really makes it.\nAmazing couple DK and Deepika.....\ntruly made for each other \u2764\ufe0f\n\nSource: https://lnkd.in/d-8Rt4-Z\nhttps://lnkd.in/dYv6q_62\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/dgAv92Pe\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/dfKvA5Mx",
