THE girl.\n\nWe met again, I insisted. With every sentence she said, I fell deeper and deeper in love. She was a visionary, building her dreams into the future! A strong little girl, bootstrapping a fantastic tech company. She would organize international collaboration and never ask for credit. She would always find time to build schools in post-war regions at the cost of sleep and well being. She would put bars so high that nothing and no one would match her criteria. That's how the world saw her, but to me, she was my sweet little pumpkin. The softest person I knew. \n\nI was 26, and she was 28. We lived in pain and loneliness until we found each other. It was a match made in heavens. The first girl I ever kissed. We haven't had a single fight. Citizens of different countries with entirely different life journeys, we couldn't be more similar. It was absolute harmony and true happiness. She changed me entirely.\n\nSona. My Sona. \n\nSona \ud83c\udf3f Mnatsakanyan",

A few months later a friend asked me to join him for a Sailing Class, where I learnt about the Colaba Sailing Club. A no-nonsense club built for aspiring sailors (leisure or otherwise).\nThe benefit the club offers is access to some gorgeous Seabird & Lightning class boats, access to the sailing community and ultimately the superpower to start sailing without any prior expertise whatsoever.\n\nOver the next few weeks, I\u2019m going to start sharing content from my Sails with the objective of\n(1) to hopefully entertain you\n(2) to evangelise this gorgeous hobby/sport\n(3) and encourage you to join the CSC in time for the post-monsoon Season!\n\n\nAs the Danish author, Isak Dinesen said \u201cThe cure for anything is saltwater \u2013 sweat, tears, or the sea.\u201d \ud83c\udf0a\n\n(In the short video, I\u2019ve taken one of the CSC boats out for a fairly rough afternoon Sail. This is on a weekend in April. Every year after Holi, the wind shifts and starts to come from the South/ Prongs Lighthouse. I wonder if these are the onset of the SW Monsoon Winds?)\n\n#MunafKapadia #Sailor #Sailing #BoatLife #SeaAdventures #SeaLife #Sailors #SailingClub #BombaySailingClub #SailAway #ColabaSailingClub",

So I did some research on how to reduce it. \n\nHere are some of the methods to reduce the pipeline time \ud83d\udc47\n\n1. Write optimized UTs\nWriting UTs are easy and knowing what to write and how to write is important.\n\n2. Use mockups in tests\nYou don't need to test your database or API connections in every UTs, replace API calls or DB calls with mocks.\n\n3. Delete old codes\nActively delete the codes/tests no longer in use, the CI server won't waste its precious time on those tests.\n\n4. Pararellize your build\nThere are many ways you can run your maven/npm build in parallel (talking about 1 build running on multiple threads)\n\n5. Move to micro-services architecture\nOne of the pros of micro-services over monoliths is lesser build time.\n\n6. Cache your dependencies\nMost of the CI servers already cache it but do check\n\nI will be posting a video on how to write optimised UTs on my Youtube(in comments) tomorrow, do check it out.\n\nFollow Abhishek R. for future posts.\n\nRead More -> #abhishekrajtalks\n\n#cicd #tech #backend #frontend #engineering",

Many folks on our team have received social media and WhatsApp messages saying I was in some urgent need of money from fake accounts. \n\nFake Instagram profiles of well-known people are created by copying everything from the original profile. The followers of these fake accounts then get messages to buy paid courses, scammy penny stocks and crypto.\n Here's an example of my ID being used. (image)\n\nLuring customers to share login credentials by using greed. Once the fraudster has access to the account, losses are created and money is transferred to other trading accounts by trading penny stocks, illiquid options or transferring stocks. (link in comments)\n\nThe craziest one is fraudsters advertising the customer support number of a large company on Google. When the customer calls up the number, the scamsters ask for a UPI transfer or send UPI pull requests from handles that seem like they belong to the main brand.",

Keeping this variance of marketers in mind, Symbiosis Institute of Digital & Telecom Management (SIDTM), Pune has introduced \u2018Brand Management\u2019 as a subject under the \u2018Marketing and Finance\u2019 specialization.\n\nStudents choosing to study Brand Management will be exposed to various branding strategies, project budgeting, launches alongside Integrated Media Communications, and the theory of consumer data analytics in the marketing domain.\n\nSYMBIOSIS INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY\nSymbiosis Centre for Alumni Engagement\n\n#Digital #Telecom #SIDTM #Symbiosis #Technology #management #MBA #career #future #MBAcolleges #Success #bschool #business #industry #Curriculum #knowledge #domain #leadership #development #values #achievement #contribution",

        "content": "For any data-driven approach for physical simulations for high dimensional parameter space, sampling becomes a big issue. To mitigate this issue, we have developed parametric physics-informed greedy latent space dynamics identification algorithms, so called gLaSDI. This is an extension of our previous paper, LaSDI, so gLaSDI follows the same framework as LaSDI, i.e., compress the simulation data with auto-encoder to form a latent space and identify dynamics in the latent space with a predefined ODE. Unlike LaSDI, gLaSDI relies on physics-informed error indicator to determine where in parameter space to sample on the fly during the training phase, which leads to sub-optimal (if not optimal) sampling procedure. \n\nFor example, the figure below compares the accuracy of LaSDI with uniform grid sampling and physics-informed greedy sampling. Although both approaches use the same number of training data, i.e., 36, gLaSDI achieves the maximum relative error around 4%, while LaSDI with the uniform sampling suffers with the maximum relative error close to  250%. \n\nYou can find all about gLaSDI at the following arXiv paper:\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gDmXu65j\n\n#Kudos to Xiaolong He, William (Bill) Fries, Jon Belof, Jiun-Shyan Chen for this awesome work!\n\nI am sure you will enjoy this work, so please do take advantage of it!\n\n#neuralnetworks #machinelearning #ai #physics #simulations #rom #data #training #physicsinformed #greedy #sampling #algorithms #techniques #innovation #research #science #fluid #advection #optimal #work",

You always learn a thing or two. For example, we learned yet one more weird fact about AWS API inconsistency, maybe you already know- The S3 Bucket location API always returns null for all the buckets in US East (N. Virginia) region and returns actual AWS API region names for all other locations. Not an interesting bit of information unless you\u2019re dealing with AWS cloud at the API level.\n\nAWS continuously rolls out new innovative AWS services and enhancements to the existing services. Keeping track of AWS services, and the AWS resources created is of tremendous importance for security, cost and general cloud hygiene. Hence we started CloudYali to be the single only source of truth, which has all the AWS resource (AWS assets) information for all AWS services being deployed from all the AWS regions. Missing even a single resource from any remote region or AWS service is simply out of question. This is easier said than done, but that\u2019s where the challenge comes.",

From this, we can ensure the person's identity is real or not.\n2) Or there is a second option where it requires the user to upload their KYC document (any 1) to proceed.\nThe user has the option to choose between the first and second one.\n3) I also added some safety tips for dating to keep the user informed.\n4) I added a GPS option through which location can be shared with friends and family to keep track if the person decides to go on a date.\nI am still iterating on it. Your feedback would be valuable in helping me iterate and bring out a better version of it.\n\nSo this was my UX as well as UI Presentation.\n Thank You!\u00a0Crowwwn\u00a0for giving me this opportunity. I hope you like it, and any feedback is much appreciated!\nThanks & Regards\n\n\n#uxdesign\u00a0#uidesign\u00a0#userexperience\u00a0#userinterface\u00a0#uxui\u00a0#entrylevel\u00a0#uxdesigner\u00a0#figma\u00a0#adobexd\u00a0#google\u00a0#grateful\u00a0#userexperience\u00a0#userresearch\u00a0#wireframe\u00a0#prototyping\u00a0#internship\u00a0#share\u00a0#team\u00a0#opportunities\u00a0#people\u00a0#emphathize\u00a0#define\u00a0#ideate\u00a0#prototype\u00a0#test\u00a0#productdesign\u00a0#productdesigner #thankyou #connections #ux #opportunity #like #ui",

        "content": "Few tips for students, generally for staying a balanced and contented career/Life: \n1) Never compare yourself with others, you are unique. Everything is subjective: successful career, papers, partners, girl/boy friends, materialistic possession etc. \n2) Be ambitious: set small achievable-realistic goals, and a long term goal where you want to be ultimately.\n3) Read a lot and don't hesitate to discuss or reach out to people if you need clarification/guidance/motivation.\n4) Increase your network, but don't bombard other's inbox with insensitive queries, comments, etc.\n5) Organise and be disciplined in your approaches.\n6) There is no substitute to Hard work, but in today's world it's also important to Work hard Smartly. Don't hesitate to learn/adapt new technology, approaches and interpretations. \n7) Encourage criticism with positive attitude. There is always a possibility that someone would come up with better ways to resolve a problem.\n8) Inculcate a good hobby. Personally, I have benefited a lot being away from lab trekking during the weekends. It's relaxing and many a times, best experimental plans came while trekking. \n9) Be approachable, and have a cordial relationship with your colleagues, friends, and spouse.\n10) Slightest moment when you feel that you need help, please don't hesitate to reach out to your friends, family and take professional counselling.  #students #career",

        "content": "My launch station !\n\u00a0\nDiphu railway station - Wikipedia has just 5 lines assigned to this place. But for me this railway station will always be so much more than just another station. It will always be a place that I have used to tick off milestones....a lot of them.\n\u00a0\nThis is \u2026\n\u00a0\n- The place where I took my first ever train ride with my dad, 2 decades back to reach to the city for my higher studies.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n- The place where I first experienced the anxiety of stepping into an unknown world that I was going to explore and still got excited with my hopes for a better future and gigantic big dreams.\n\u00a0\n- The place that convinced me what I had here was nice but not enough ... not at-least for me. As the first generation to go to college from my family, this place was my gateway to go out and explore the world.\n\u00a0\n- The place that I consciously lied about to my Delhi University friends ( I would say\u2026Rajdhani doesn\u2019t stop in Diphu.. it\u2019s too small a place and hence I don\u2019t travel via Rajdhani . While in reality, 20 years back - Rajdhani tickets were priced 4x more than the regular train ticket in the North East express. I simply couldn\u2019t afford a ticket in the Rajdhani). It\u2019s strange how an adolescent mind, albeit still learning is more concerned of optics.\n\u00a0\n- When I started earning..\u2026That very lie encouraged me to write 3 letters to the Indian Railways asking them to add Diphu as a stop so that I could finally experience a Rajdhani ride to my home town. I don\u2019t think any of my letters ever reached anyone significant within the railways then, but I was glad when I found out that Rajdhani stops for 1 min in there now.\n\u00a0\nThe irony is - I have never till date travelled by a Rajdhani. Once I had the means \u2026 I didn\u2019t have the luxury of time . Somehow while chasing bigger dreams \u2026 travelling by the Rajdhani went lower and lower in my to do list.\n\u00a0\nGoing back home is very special for everyone. This one was even more so. Because my kid tagged along and is grown enough to ask questions (a lot of them!) and seek answers. As a parent I may be able to give in to most of the rationale demands of my son now but I have realised that I can never give him the experience of my struggle.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut I will try to give him a lot of exposure to acknowledge and appreciate the roots that his mom comes from and is immensely proud of. And I will hope someday he finds his own source of inspirations.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTo all small town girls and (yes boys) moving to the big city with bigger dreams.\u2026..I know your struggle is real but believe me the reality of that dream is even more fulfilling.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo Dream on \u2026..\n\n#future #learning #travel #startup #newexperiences #dreamstoreality #smalltown #india",

        "content": "Yesterday while returning home, I saw this extra large banner/ outdoor ad of iPhone 13 Pro. The glaring powdered green phone in the banner proudly presents itself in \"Alpine Green\" color. I was wondering on why the hell an European mountain range gets the name of a color (proudly being sold in India) and not a mountain from India! The Green could have easily been the Nilgiris Green or Himalayan Green! So, what went wrong that our landmark landscapes, buildings, heritage never gets the name of a color but the western ones? \n\nWell, the issue remains with us. We never emphasised upon this idea of Indianizing the colors and it's names. No Indian brands ever gave a color name as Nilgiris Green, Himalayan Blue or Agra Fort Red! We feel that the color names that resonates with exotic locations/ landmarks/ heritage are more precious than our own. \n\nHence, the change of mindset has to be within us first prior to seeking the same appearing in international brands. We should be proud of our colors, culture and customs. \n\nI dream, one day the International brands like iPhone will launch their products with names such as 'Thar Yellow', 'Nilgiris Green', 'Himalayan Blue'. \n\n#Indiamatters #Colormatters #india",

They need shampoo and deodorant in a pinch, too.\n\nEnter: instant-delivery companies.\n\nYou run out of shampoo or lotion or something, it\u2019s not something you typically plan for. The ability to have these things delivered relatively quickly, it sort of sets up nicely for a lot of beauty products.\n\nGorillas, which already works with brands like Dove, Olay, and Aveeno, sees plenty more potential in the space.\n\nSo do other startups. Gopuff\u00a0partnered with Coty\u00a0in 2020 to drop off beauty fixes in 30 minutes. FastAF Technologies, Inc. now\u00a0works\u00a0with premium brands to get their goods to consumers - in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, for now - in under two hours. About a third (36%) of FastAF\u2019s order composition is beauty.\n\nValue proposition for some of these rapid-delivery companies is in driving up basket sizes and, by extension, driving up margins.\n\nUltimately, however, beauty is a growing category for rapid delivery, which is why both FastAF and Gorillas are sticking to diversifying their product mix.\n\nDo you order beauty products from quick commerce firms?\n\n#quickcommerce #qcommerce #instantdelivery #beautyproducts #beautybrand #fastaf #gorillas #deliveryapp",

At the boat jetty next to the airport, we were greeted by troupes of sea lions frolicking in the Pacific waters \u2013 a befitting introduction to an island believed to host more biodiversity than the famous Galapagos.\n\nVolcanic rock formations, Mars-like red soil deserts, forests hundreds of years old that evolved in isolation, the endangered red fire-crown hummingbird - over the past few weeks, we\u2019ve been incredibly lucky to hike, camp, kayak, snorkel and experience some of Isla Robinson Crusoe\u2019s wild beauty. With nothing but the Pacific Ocean on all sides for hundreds of kilometres, this feels like the furthest place on earth. But it\u2019s also starting to feel a little like home\u2026,\u201d says Shivya Nath, an eco-conscious storyteller and traveller, a few weeks after landing on the remote island of Robinson Crusoe, situated 700 km off mainland Chile in a tiny archipelago called Juan Fernandez Islands.\n\nEmpowered by Lenovo\u2019s smart technology, Shivya spent a month with other volunteers selected by Lenovo for its Work for Humankind program initiated in collaboration with NGO Island Conservation and the Chilean government.

I think most of the pregnant woman\u2019s may feel the same. But when we say about this to the drivers most of them are really kind and trying their best to drive smoothly.\u00a0\n\nDear automobile service providers if you put a simple checkmark in your mobile apps which passengers can select, that indicates to the driver that there is a pregnant woman travelling in the current trip, It would be a great help to all the pregnant womens.\u00a0\nYou can also put a baby icon or mother with a baby icon as a map navigator to remind the drivers, since most of them uses navigation maps.\n\nThis seems a simple feature but it may saves a life. \n#olacabs #rapido #uber #automobileindustry #socialemedia #socialgood #pregnancycare #socialresponsibility #childcare #smartapp #ola #uberdriver #travel",

Literally what more could I ask for. These are the days we live for.\u00a0\n\nHad a fantastic time with Mr. Adani and I can't even tell you ki maine itne chote span of time me inse kitna kuch seekh liya hai. The amount of knowledge you get by simply observing people and talking to them is just impeccable. Getting to meet a man like him, was definitely my privilege.\n\n\u00a0I am still unable to process the entire evening, but jo bhi tha mere jaise ek middle class ladke k liye ye bs ek sapna hi ho skta thaa and legit maine ye sapna experience kiya hai in reality. A man like Mr. Adani has a different aura around him and you can just feel it.\u00a0\n\nSomewhere I feel so full and satisfied that probably I am falling short of words. But still whatever the case maybe we all know that Mr.Adani was, is and will always be an inspiration for millions of us out there. Eagerly waiting to meet him again very very soon.\n\nPrafull MBA CHAI WALA \n\n#adani #entrepreneurship #opportunity #economicconclaveindia",

This statement stands true as far as compression for short videos is concerned.\n\nWhile compression aids in delivering videos in ready-made formats, it also should be packed with crucial parameters that provide better control and at the same time make the entire process fast & efficient.\n\nIn this blog, we talk about the CLI tool that we have created enabling optimisation with a renewed focus on user-friendliness. Adhering to strict standards on quality ensures greater output during playback. Through this processing mechanism, we have achieved a method for easy compression while drastically reducing the cost involved.",

And use them to build a monument.\u201d \n\nWith these words Ratan Tata returned to Mumbai without signing the deal. \n\nLater, newer upgrades of the car, named Indica V2, quickly became a mass favourite.\n\nA man with a simple lifestyle and golden heart saw several failures and converted them into success.\n\n2008: Tata saved the Ford company from getting bankrupt by purchasing its two luxurious brands Jaguar and Land Rover. \n\n66% of Tata Sons' equity is held by the Tata Trusts, and dividends flow directly to support the philanthropic work of the Trusts.\n\nHe is the reason why Tata Group became a global powerhouse within the span of 3 decades.\n\nRatan Tata is a true global leadership inspiration who has lifted thousands of young talents and showcased India to the world.\n\n#ratantata #tatagroup #tataneu #globalbusiness #whatinspiresme",

I just pickup my phone & start writing whatever comes up.\nMost of my writing is spontaneous, I dont have any calendar or topics to write. I write everyday for at least 3-4 hours.\n\nI follow DOTS (Do One Thing Surely). Focus has changed my life completely.\n\nI also dont face writers block because I dont write from my mind.\n\nThe best part is all my work is available for free for anyone to read.\n\nI do ghost write for several firms & people.\n\nI find it more challenging to write normal posts than viral posts:) But I am improving fast.

So instead of enrolling into a University in the US or UK, he took a job as a salesman in Dunlop Singapore, initially selling t-shirts, rackets and golf balls too! \n\nThe lack of tertiary education did not hold him back because academic knowledge does not cultivate an appetite for initiative, risk-taking and seizing opportunities. That was learned from countless hours of interning (he called it free child labor)  in his father's business. \n\nToday he is a multi-millionaire because of his apartment leasing/airB&B business and property investments.\n\nAt 62, he continues running the business with gusto.\n\nWhen an employee is sick, he would take over and clean the apartment, do repairs, clear the drains; clean the toilets, pick up customers from the airport, drive them to the apartment, check them in, make recommendations about which local sights to visit, and how to get there.\n\nBeing from a rich family help a lot but his humility, intelligence and work ethic are what made the difference.\n\nAgree?",

And that erodes system's #growth.\n\nNow, I am not against IAS officers. I am all in for their extraordinary contribution to the nation and perhaps they are not to be blamed for settling into this age-old culture. \n\nBut if they won't change the culture of \"Ma'am/Sir\", who will ?\n\nOur system needs change. And that change can come while learning to be respectful but not submissive. We need to question and change the school principal like treatment of government officers. \n\nToday, as a Co-CEO, I politely request anyone who calls me Ma'am to address me by my first name because I know this \"Sir/Maam\" Wall will set back my organization by decades.\n\nWe need a more liberal working culture if we want our economy and society to prosper. \n\nIf 21st-century Indian won't, who will?",

I'd rather have my gender identity included in the greeting as well, it's nice to be welcomed, if others next to me are too. Hearing that kind of language, used still quite regularly, does not boost my hope of seeing a future that is free from the gender binary norm.\n\nWe at Accenture receive regularly training in the topics of inclusion and diversity, which I really love. I recall seeing some of these words in some of those trainings as well, and thinking I should really, really remember to stop using the term \"guys\" or Finnish equivalents and replace it with \"folks\". Being non-binary myself I probably do remember a bit more often than an average binary person to not make assumptions about someone's gender indentity based on their physical looks and first name, but honestly, certain type of language is so ingrained in my vocabulary as well due to 40+ years of exposure to that type of language, that despite good intentions, I often catch myself slipping as well. Unlearning of habits you've carried most of your life may be slow but I'm positive we can all get there if we give it the good old college try. \n\nSmall effort for everyone, enormous significance to folks who are so used to have their existence not validated same way others' are in normal everyday life that they don't even bother to put up a fight in fear of being seen as a nitpicking fusspot.\n #inclusion #diversity #inclusivelanguage",

I will get to work with Elizabeth Churchill and a lot of other brilliant folks on new technologies and tools that will empower developers to build better products and solutions. While the teams are mainly in California and New York, I will be working remotely from Aalborg - doing the long commute when needed \u2708\ufe0f\n\nHaving worked with a broad spectrum of Google technologies for more than a decade and applied these through teaching, research, consulting and startup projects, it is an amazing opportunity to get to work 'at the core' on some of the foundational technologies and new products that will power future innovation and potentially reach billions of people. It is also a dream role, as it affords me the opportunity to stay in touch with the academic, startup and developer communities. I look forward to contributing to these from 'the other side' going forward \ud83c\udf0e\u00a0\n\nWhile starting a new adventure is amazing, it is also very hard to say goodbye to the wonderful colleagues, students and friends at AU Engineering, Aarhus University. Having started and built ORBIT Lab from its basic ideas up to the growing and thriving tech and innovation hub it has become, I am very proud to have been part of this journey and amazing team. Together we have accomplished so much over the past years - yet there are still so much more to be done.\nThe potential and stakes are high, as the department has an exemplary ability to create the talent, knowledge and solutions needed for many of the big societal challenges the world is facing, and a unique engineering and research DNA that fosters innovation and collaboration.\nFor all of our collaborators and community members: rest assured that everything is in the best of hands. I am confident that the department, along with ORBIT Lab and all of the innovation initiatives, collaborations and projects across Aarhus University and beyond, will continue and grow - and I will enjoy following your continued successes and impact! \ud83d\ude80\n\nBig life altering decisions are both difficult and exciting and I feel very grateful to have made it this far and been offered this new opportunity. I want to give some heartfelt thanks to Bela Kriger, M.C. Altman, and Michael Davis, who caringly and expertly led me through the recruitment process, and to my interviewers for interesting and challenging discussions while also taking time to answer questions and share personal insights about work and culture. My thanks extend to the Googler contacts, friends and family who gave advice and encouragement all the way - you know who you are \u2764\ufe0f\n\u00a0\nI look forward to humbly putting on my noogler hat and starting out on this new adventure!!\n\n#google #noogler #technology #ux #research #engineering #innovation #devtools #adventure",
