Then data from the primary & secondary sources were merged for Zaloni\u2019s Tier-1 opportunities and accordingly content like Whitepaper, eBooks etc. were created to be sent to their account owners like email marketing and social boosting.

To achieve this data was taken from a primary data source like Know Your Customer (KYC), where the investigation was done to find if subscribers used \u2018double telco\u2019 including competitor sim. This meant they had to be using a dual sim phone to carry a competitor sim. So, from the KYC data, I looked for either information on any competitor sim a subscriber might possess or the type of devices he/she was using with a propensity to carry a competitor sim. With that data, I focused on those subscribers with the most lucrative offers to fend off any competitor\u2019s attempt to win them. The result was a 21% increase in the retention & significant revenue percentage for those last two quarters of that year.   Since I had all primary source data at my disposal, no secondary source data was used in this research project.",
