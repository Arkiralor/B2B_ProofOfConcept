                "description": "Network Travels is the largest private bus fleet operator in Assam and North East India established in the year 1992. The first Government-recognized tour operator in North East India, the company was incorporated to provide connectivity by road to important destinations within the region and is currently the largest operator in this segment.\n\nProblems:\nInconvenience: Customers\u2019 needs to visit bus counters for booking tickets, costing them both money and time.\nUnsystematic: Since tickets are booked manually over the phone, errors are inevitable like multiple booking of the same seat.\nLoss: Less number of officially booked tickets resulted in customer\u2019s loss and roadside pickups of passengers by drivers and conductors led to the loss of authorized agents and negative branding of the company.\nExtended staff: Ticket booking agent\u2019s commission had to be calculated manually and commission had to be sent through cheque or bank deposits. This required additional manpower which is a burden to the company.\n\nSolution:\nDevelop a Web portal and mobile application so that general public as well as personnel from various Network Travels Head office, bus counters across North East can book tickets online. The application is a one-stop solution with a secure facility to make online payments and book tickets for the desired destination. The administrator of the portal is to manage transactions of the users of the website. Admin can update or modify some parts of the application through the admin panel provided and also add info of newer solution heads or additions to existing ones and also update any new services that Network Travels like to extend to the customers. The admin cannot modify any order and can neither alter nor change any part of the order. Admin can of course set discounts or offers for the customers for any given route, for promoting the app and to increase sales.",
